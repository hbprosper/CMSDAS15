CMSDAS Bari INFN 2015 - Bayesian Neural Network

Description
-----------
Discriminate between VBF and ggF production modes of pp -> H -> 4l events 

To run:
-------
     python train.py

Periodically check progression of training using

     net-display -h vbfggf.bin

To create a self-contained C++ function that encapsulates the BNN do

     netwrite -n 100 vbfggf

output:

     vbfggf.cpp

To plot:
--------
     python plot.py

output:
     fig_bnn.png
     fig_bnn.pdf
